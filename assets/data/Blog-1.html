        <h1>Minimizing Portfolio Risk</h1>
        <h3>Published on July 1st, 2025</h3>

        <p><b>Objective</b></p>

        <p>The primary goal of this project is to minimize the risk of a portfolio by optimizing the weight allocation of its constituent assets. Portfolio risk is primarily driven by the individual volatilities of the assets and the correlations between them. By adjusting asset weights—without changing the asset selection—we aim to achieve improved capital preservation and volatility control. </p>

        <p><b>Asset Selection</b></p>

        <p>The portfolio comprises 15 actively traded U.S. equities, selected from the most active stocks in the market. These span multiple sectors, ensuring diversification:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Large-cap Technology & Growth: Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), Palantir (PLTR), Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI)</li>
            <li>Financials & Fintech: SoFi Technologies Inc. (SOFI), Oscar Health Inc. (OSCR)</li>
            <li>Traditional Sectors: Ford Motor (F), Intel Corporation (INTC), American Airlines (AAL), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)</li>
            <li>Metals & Mining: B2Gold Corp (BTG), Riot Platforms (RIOT)</li>
            <li>EV & Green Tech: Lucid Group Inc. (LCID)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Data Source: Yahoo Finance</p>
        <p>Date Range: January 1, 2024 – January 1, 2025</p>

        <p>We begin with an Equal-Weighted Portfolio, where each asset is assigned a uniform weight of 1/n (n = number of assets). 
            This neutral starting point provides a baseline for comparison with the optimized portfolio. Portfolio risk is calculated using 
            the standard deviation of returns, which is then annualized using the square root of 252 (the average number of trading days in a 
            year). To identify the optimal allocation that minimizes portfolio risk, we employ the scipy.optimize.minimize function from the 
            SciPy library. This function minimizes a user-defined objective function—here, getPortfolioRisk()—subject to the constraint that 
            the weights must sum to one.</p>

        <p><b>Results and Analysis</b></p>

        <p>Annualized Risk of Equal-Weighted Portfolio: 29.62% <br>
            Annualized Risk of Minimum-Risk Portfolio: 17.91%</p>

        <p>The optimization significantly reduces portfolio risk by over 11 percentage points, demonstrating the effectiveness of strategic
            weight reallocation. The resulting Minimum-Risk Portfolio heavily favors the most stable assets:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Apple (AAPL) – 49.80%</li>
            <li>Amazon (AMZN) – 18.41%</li>
            <li>Ford Motor (F) – 13.11%</li>
            <li>B2Gold Corp (BTG) – 11.06%</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Together, these four stocks account for approximately 92.38% of the portfolio's total allocation, underscoring their 
            comparatively low volatility and favorable correlation profiles.</p>
