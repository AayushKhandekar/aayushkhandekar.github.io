                Implied volatility is one of the most critical concepts in options pricing and trading. It represents the market's 
                expectation of how volatile a stock will be over the life of an option. However, implied volatility isn't something 
                directly observable. It's not quoted like a stock price. Instead, it's inferred from the market price of an option using 
                a pricing model like Black-Scholes-Merton. In essence, implied volatility is the value of the volatility input that, when 
                plugged into the Black-Scholes formula, gives a theoretical price that matches the actual market price of the option.

            <p>
                The challenge, however, is that the Black-Scholes formula cannot be rearranged to isolate and solve for 
                volatility. This is because volatility appears in multiple locations within the formula, such as inside a logarithmic term 
                and under a square root. Therefore, to find the implied volatility, we must use numerical methods to approximate the value 
                of that makes the model price equal to the market price. One of the simplest and most intuitive ways to do this is by 
                using a binary search algorithm.

            <p>
                In a binary search approach, we start with a lower and upper bound for the volatility and iteratively narrow the 
                interval by comparing the modelâ€™s price at the midpoint to the observed market price. If the model price is too low, 
                it means our guessed volatility is too low, so we shift the lower bound upward. If the model price is too high, we reduce 
                the upper bound. This process continues until the model price is sufficiently close to the market price within a small 
                tolerance.

            <p>
                This method was implemented in Python to compute the implied volatility for a European call option using the 
                Black-Scholes model. Given parameters such as the current stock price, strike price, time to expiration, interest rate, 
                and the market price of the call option, the algorithm successfully finds the implied volatility. In the example, the 
                market price of the call option was $1.875, and the algorithm found that a volatility of approximately 30.04% would 
                make the Black-Scholes model return this price.

            <p>
                In practice, implied volatility plays a central role in assessing market sentiment, comparing options across different 
                strikes and maturities, and implementing volatility-based trading strategies. It is often used by traders to identify 
                options that are overpriced or underpriced relative to their historical or expected volatility. Understanding how to 
                compute implied volatility, and why it matters, is essential for any student or practitioner of quantitative finance 
                or derivatives trading.
